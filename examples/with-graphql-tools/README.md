## With graphql-tools example

after Apollo team release new version of graphql-tools, we can merge our schema across between library so you can use both graphql-compose with graphql-tools

## Run demo
> Note: you need to build Graphql-compose before run this example
```
npm i
node index.js
// go to http://localhost:3000/graphqi
```
