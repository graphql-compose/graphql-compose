# Quick start guide

This guide will help you to easily create GraphQL Schemas that covers all your needs. We'll start by giving you information on how to install Graphql Composer. After that we create Type Composer objects (GraphQLObjectTypes that are editable), edit the TypeComposers with custom fields, setup connections,
and then finally generate a schema that you can use.

At the end we'll add a relay support to the graphql.

We always try to make our documentation better, so if you have feedback on the Guide please let us know in [our Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/graphql-compose/Lobby) or [open an Issue in our Github repository](https://github.com/nodkz/graphql-compose/issues/new)
